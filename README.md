# Python_Neural_Network
A basic neural network written in Python only using numpy.

The theory that I used to write the code based on information in the online book Neural Networks and Deep Learning by Micheal Nielsen. http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/

Included in the repository is the Python code along with a graph showing the result of the network training to model a sine function, the training data was inputs from 0 to 2pi while the test data was inputs from 0 to 4pi. This difference is obvious in how the network does not work very well after 2pi.
